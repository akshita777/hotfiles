# My Kitty Config: The Ultimate Terminal Experience

This is my Kitty configuration. It's fast, it's beautiful, and it's probably the best terminal emulator on the planet. If you're still using a different terminal, you're doing it wrong.

## `kitty.conf`: The Holy Grail

This is my main config file. I've customized it to my liking, and I'm pretty sure it's perfect. Here are some of the things I've done:

*   **Theme:** I'm using a custom theme that's easy on the eyes. It's so good, you'll want to stare at it all day.
*   **Font:** I'm using a Nerd Font, because I'm a nerd. It's got all the glyphs and icons you could ever want.
*   **Opacity:** I like a little bit of transparency in my terminal. It makes me feel like I'm living in the future.
*   **Cursor:** I've got a blinking cursor that's so mesmerizing, you'll forget what you were typing.

I've also tweaked a bunch of other settings to make my terminal experience as enjoyable as possible. I'm not going to list them all here, because I'm lazy. But trust me, it's good.
