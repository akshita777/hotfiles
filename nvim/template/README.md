# The `template` Directory: Because Starting from Scratch is for Amateurs

This directory contains templates for different types of files. Because who has time to start from scratch every single time? Not me. I'm too busy optimizing my workflow, or staring blankly at the screen.

I've got templates for Bash scripts, Lua config files, and even test initialization files. It's like having a head start on all your projects.

## How to Add Your Own Templates

If you want to add a new template, just create a new file in this directory. Then you can use the `:Template` command (which I've defined, because I'm thoughtful) to create a new file based on that template. It's so easy, even a caveman could do it.
