# The `ftdetect` Directory: Because Neovim Isn't Perfect

This is where I keep all my custom filetype detections. Because sometimes, Neovim needs a little help. It's like having a friend who's really smart, but also a little bit dumb.

I've added a few custom detections for things like Git config files and i3 config files. It's not much, but it's honest work.

## How to Add Your Own Detections

If you have a filetype that Neovim is struggling with, just add a new `.lua` file to this directory. It's not rocket science. If you can't figure it out, you're on your own.
