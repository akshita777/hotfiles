# The `zettelkasten` Directory: My Brain, but Better Organized

This directory contains the configuration and templates for my Zettelkasten note-taking system. I use the `telekasten.nvim` plugin to manage my notes. It's like having a second brain, but this one actually remembers things.

## Templates: Because I'm Not a Robot (Yet)

I've got a few templates to get me started:

*   `daily.md`: For my daily musings, complaints, and existential crises.
*   `new_note.md`: For when a brilliant idea strikes, usually in the shower.
*   `weekly.md`: For reflecting on the past week and planning for the next. It's like therapy, but cheaper.

## How to Use My Zettelkasten (if you dare)

If you want to dive into my brain, you'll need the `telekasten.nvim` plugin. Then you can create new notes, search for existing ones, and get lost in a web of interconnected thoughts. It's a wild ride.
