# The `ftplugin` Directory: Filetype-Specific Shenanigans

This directory contains settings that are specific to certain filetypes. Because not all files are created equal. Some files need a little extra love, and some files just need to be left alone.

Currently, I'm just using it to allow comments in JSON files. Because who doesn't love a good comment? It's like a little note to your future self, saying "I was here, and I was confused."

## How to Add Your Own Shenanigans

If you want to add some filetype-specific shenanigans, just create a new `.lua` file in this directory. It's pretty straightforward. If you can't figure it out, you're probably not cut out for this.
