# The `luasnip-snippets` Directory: My Personal Cheat Sheet

This is where I keep my personal collection of snippets for the `LuaSnip` plugin. Because who has time to type out everything? Not me. I'm too busy contemplating the meaning of life, or watching cat videos.

I've got snippets for all sorts of languages and common coding patterns. It's like having a personal assistant who types for you, but without the awkward small talk.

## How to Add Your Own Cheats

If you want to add your own snippets, just create a new `.lua` file in this directory. It's pretty easy. If you can't figure it out, maybe coding isn't for you.
