# The `after` Directory: The After-Party for Your Editor

This is where I put all the stuff that needs to be loaded last. It's like the after-party for your editor. You know, the part where all the cool kids show up and do all the cool stuff.

In my case, I'm just using it to wrap long lines in the quickfix window. It's not very exciting, but it's important.

## How to Use This Directory

If you have something that needs to be loaded after everything else, just throw it in here. It's that simple. If you can't figure it out, you probably shouldn't be using my dotfiles.
