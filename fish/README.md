# My Fish Shell Configuration: The Only Shell You'll Ever Need

This is my personal configuration for the Fish shell. If you're still using Bash or Zsh, I'm not judging... much. Fish is fast, it's smart, and it's got more features than a Swiss Army knife. I've customized it to make it even more powerful and efficient for my workflow. It's like a superpower for your terminal.

## The Core Files (the ones that make the magic happen)

*   `config.fish`: The main entry point. It's like the brain of the operation, telling everything else what to do.
*   `abbreviations.fish`: My personal dictionary of shortcuts. Because who has time to type out full commands?
*   `fish_plugins`: The list of all the cool plugins I use. I manage them with `fisher`, because I'm fancy.

## The Organized Chaos (my directory structure)

I've organized my configuration into several directories, because I like things neat (sometimes):

*   `completions`: Custom completions for all my favorite tools. It's like having a mind-reader for your terminal.
*   `conf.d`: Small configuration snippets. It's like a bunch of sticky notes, but for code.
*   `functions`: All my custom Fish functions. They're like little robots that do my bidding.
*   `themes`: Where I keep all my pretty themes. Because a good-looking shell is a happy shell.

I'll go into more detail about each of these directories in their own `README.md` files. But don't expect too much, I'm not a writer.
