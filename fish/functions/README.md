# My Custom Fish Functions: Little Robots That Do My Bidding

This directory contains all of my custom Fish functions. I've written these functions to streamline my workflow and make common tasks easier. They're like little robots that do my bidding, but without the risk of a robot uprising.

I've tried to give them memorable names, so I can easily remember them. But sometimes, I still forget. It's a work in progress.

Here are some of my most frequently used functions (the ones I actually remember):

*   `backup`: For when I'm feeling paranoid and want to save everything.
*   `clean-unzip`: Extracts an archive and then deletes the original file. Because clutter is the enemy.
*   `clone-cd`: Clones a Git repository and then immediately changes into the new directory. Because I'm impatient.
*   `dsize`: Shows the size of all the directories in the current directory. For when I'm running out of space and need to blame someone.
*   `ex`: A shortcut for extracting various types of archives. Because life's too short to type `tar -xvf`.
*   `f`: A wrapper around `fzf` for finding files. Because I'm always losing things.
*   `gfetch`: A git fetch command with a custom output format. Because I like my Git output to be pretty.
*   `info`: Displays information about a file or command. For when I'm feeling curious.
*   `l`, `la`, `ll`, `ls`: Various aliases for `ls` with different options. Because I like options.
*   `mkdir-cd`: Creates a directory and then immediately changes into it. Because I'm efficient.
*   `pages`: Opens a man page in a browser. Because reading man pages in the terminal is for masochists.
*   `proc`: A wrapper around `ps` for finding processes. Because sometimes, I need to kill things.
*   `rga-fzf`: A combination of `ripgrep-all` and `fzf` for searching through files. Because I'm a search addict.
*   `up`: Updates all of my packages and tools. Because I like to live on the bleeding edge.

I have many other functions as well, but these are the ones I use most often. Feel free to browse through the files in this directory to see everything I've created. But don't judge me.
