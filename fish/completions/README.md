# My Custom Fish Completions: Because Typing is Hard

This directory contains custom completions for various command-line tools that I use. Fish's autocompletion system is one of its best features, and I've extended it to support some of the tools that don't have them by default. It's like having a personal assistant who finishes your sentences.

Here are some of the tools I've made smarter:

*   `bun`: Because JavaScript is a wild beast, and it needs taming.
*   `colorscript`: For when you need to impress your friends with fancy colors.
*   `fisher`: My plugin manager. It's so good, it completes itself.
*   `fzf_configure_bindings`: Because `fzf` is awesome, but sometimes you need a little help.
*   `mise`: For managing development environments. It's like a magic wand for your projects.
*   `pipx`: For Python apps. Because virtual environments are a pain.
*   `poetry`: For Python dependency management. It's like a librarian for your code.

These completions make my life so much easier. I don't have to remember all those pesky commands and options. My brain cells can now be used for more important things, like remembering where I left my keys.
