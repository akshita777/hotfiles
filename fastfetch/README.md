# My Fastfetch Configuration: Because My System is Prettier Than Yours

This is my personal configuration for `fastfetch`, a tool I use to display system information in a visually appealing way. Because who doesn't want to show off their sick Arch Linux setup? It's like a digital peacock, and I'm here to flaunt it.

## `config.jsonc`: The Masterpiece

My main configuration is in the `config.jsonc` file. I've sculpted it to display the information I care about most, using icons and colors to make it easy to read at a glance. It's a work of art, really.

I've used Nerd Font icons throughout the configuration to give it a more polished look. And the colors? Oh, the colors! They're so vibrant, they'll make your eyes water (in a good way).

### Other Configurations (for when I'm feeling adventurous)

I also have a few other `fastfetch` configurations in this directory:

*   `config-compact.jsonc`: A more compact version, for when I'm feeling minimalist.
*   `config-pokemon.jsonc`: A fun configuration that uses Pok√©mon sprites. Because why not?
*   `config-v2.jsonc`: Another alternate configuration. I like options.

These are just for fun or for different use cases. My primary configuration is `config.jsonc`, because it's the best.
