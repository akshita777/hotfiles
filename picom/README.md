# My Picom Config: Eye Candy for the Soul

This is my Picom configuration, the secret sauce that makes my i3 setup look less like a relic from the 90s and more like something from a sci-fi movie. It's all about the subtle details, the little things that make you go "ooh" and "ahh."

## `picom.conf`: The Magic File

This is where the magic happens. I've tweaked and tuned this file to within an inch of its life. Here are some of the highlights:

*   **Shadows:** Because who doesn't love a good drop shadow? It's like giving your windows a little bit of personality.
*   **Fading:** I've got windows fading in and out like ghosts in the machine. It's so smooth, you'll think you're hallucinating.
*   **Transparency:** I like my terminals like I like my people: a little bit transparent. It's not for everyone, but I dig it.
*   **Rounded Corners:** I'm not a monster. I like my corners rounded. It's the little things that make life worth living.

I've also added a bunch of other tweaks and optimizations to make sure everything runs smoothly. The config file is full of comments, so you can see what I was thinking when I made these questionable life choices.
